## What is a game engine?

A game engine is basically a piece of software and APIs that gives Game Devs all the tools and stuff they need to make and develop games. It's like a middleman between the game and your computer, taking care of things like graphics, managing objects, physics, and more.

Some popular game engines include Unreal Engine, Unity Engine, and Game Maker. These engines have a bunch of features and tools to support game devs, making their workflow better, reducing development time, and helping them create some amazing gaming experiences.

## Why should you use an pre-made engine?

Writing a game engine can be very appealing, but it is equally very challenging. Here are some reasons why ready engines are preferable to creating a custom one:

* **Cost-saving**: With a pre-made engine, you just avoid such expensive licensing fees, subscription costs, and all that development time.
    
* **Simplified**: Pre-made engines take care of complicated things like rendering, physics, and user interface, so your team can focus more on making the game.
    
* **Community Support**: Popular game engines have greater communities with resources, great documentation, and support.
    
* **Compatibility with the Platform**: Most of these engines run on a wide range of consoles, PCs, phones, and other platform.
    

The scenery of game development has really started to lean towards using pre-made engines, with even big AAA studios going for established options. A trend all about the perks of these pre-made engines includes:

* **Well-established Communities**: Pre-built engines have vast active communities offering valuable resources and support.
    
* **Latest Features**: Well-established engines often have the latest features and technologies, giving developers a competitive edge.
    
* **Device Compatibility**: This way, such readymade engines are ready for immediate action on various devices, such as consoles, PCs, and even mobile phones.
    

You may be thinking that working on a custom game engine sounds cool, but using a pre-made one is way more practical and saves a lot of time for game developers. With a pre-made game engine, they can simply focus on creating fantastic games without worries about other complexities.

## What should I take into account when choosing an engine?

When selecting a game engine, it's essential to consider the following three main factors:

1. **Project scope**: Estimate how complicated and big a project your game is going to be. Other major considerations while choosing a game engine will be the kind of game and features, and the platform a game is targeted for.
    
2. **Team you have**: Assess the skills and experience of your development team. Choose an engine that aligns with your team's strengths and weaknesses. For example, if your team is familiar with C++ and has experience with Unreal Engine, it might be a good choice.
    
3. **Community support**: Consider the level of support and resources available from the engine's community, including documentation, tutorials, and forums. A strong community can help you overcome challenges and stay up-to-date with the latest features and best practices.
    

### Additional Factors to Consider

Even with those three major ones, there are a lot of other points you might want to consider:

* **Cost**: Evaluate the engine's licensing fees, subscription costs, and any additional expenses.
    
* **Platform compatibility**: Ensure the engine supports the platforms you want to target, including consoles, PCs, and mobile devices.
    
* **Learning curve**: Consider the engine's complexity and how easily your team can learn and adapt to it.
    

## What engine is the best?

The best engine will be defined by your needs. But here you have a list of engines their strengths and weaknesses, also some games that were done in the engine so you can see what is possible.
