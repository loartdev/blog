Unreal Engine has revolutionized the landscape of digital content creation, establishing itself as a game changer across multiple industries. Known for its cutting-edge technology and versatility, Unreal Engine empowers developers and artists to create stunningly realistic and immersive experiences. Its robust suite of tools and features, such as real-time rendering, advanced animation systems, and dynamic lighting, allows for unparalleled creative freedom and efficiency. Whether in gaming, film, architecture, or simulation, Unreal Engine's continuous innovation and adaptability make it an indispensable asset for pushing the boundaries of what's possible in digital storytelling and interactive design.

## What is Unreal Engine?

Unreal Engine is one of the biggest game engines on the current market. Bringing to live some of the most advanced and impressive features compared to its competitors. UE (Unreal Engine) is not only used on the Game Industry but also on film, architecture, simulation, automobile, and more. With is broad amount of features, UE has been empowering devs and creatives for over 2 decades. And its latest version, Unreal Engine 5.x is without a doubt the most powerful version.

## What features are better on Unreal Engine 5.5?

UE 5.5 came with a lot of new and improved features, from better animation authoring tools, to a new light system for super complex scenes.

### MegaLights!

This is one of the coolest features that were announced, while it is currently experimental, MegaLights is a game changer. This system allows for hundreds of dynamic lights and other emissive surfaces to be used, casting shadows and affecting global illumination, removing the limit we used to have on past versions, and increasing the performance of highly complex scenes.

### In-Editor Animation Workflow

Unreal Engine developers focused on improving the animation system inside the engine, redesigning the **Sequencer** to improve the workflow, improving filters and the access to properties. They also added Non-destructive animations layers, and animatable animation deformers in your control rigs.

### MetaHuman Animator

Last year, MetaHuman animator allowed anyone to create facial animation from actor performance. But now it allows for audio-driven animation, generating full face animation on your MetaHuman Character with just a couple of click and the auto track from a voice actor. This tool creates accurate lip sync using AI, and it works with a variety of different languages and non-verbal sounds.

### Mutable Character Customization

This new feature allows for the creation of dynamic Skeletal Meshes, Materials, and Textures at Runtime, while keeping the shader cost low, reducing the draw call count, and optimizing memory usage. This feature allows the creator to create customizable character, weapons, cars, and more, while keeping a relatively simple workflow!

### Mobile game development

Unreal Engine 5.5 has made significant improvements to its mobile platform capabilities. Here are the key features:

* **Mobile Forward Renderer**: Supports new features such as:
    
    * D-buffer decals
        
    * Rectangular area lights
        
    * Capsule shadows
        
    * Moveable IES textures for point and spotlights
        
    * Volumetric fog
        
    * Niagara particle lights
        
* **Screen-space reflections**: Now work in both Mobile Forward and Deferred Renderers
    
* **Runtime automatic PSO (Pipeline State Object) precaching**: Enabled by default, offering a faster and easier alternative to manual PSO gathering workflows
    
* **Mobile Previewer**: Improved with features such as:
    
    * Capturing and previewing a specific Android device profile
        
    * Emulating half-precision 16-bit float shaders to detect and deal with artifacts
        

These advancements aim to cement Unreal Engine as the best engine for mobile and cross-platform AAA game development.

## Conclusion

The release of Unreal Engine 5.5 marks an important milestone in digital content creation, providing programmers and creatives with a formidable collection of tools that push the boundaries of what's possible. By enhancing creative capabilities and streamlining workflows, it not only enhances the quality of interactive experiences, it also makes the development process more intuitive and efficient. As the industry continues to evolve, Unreal Engine 5.5 ensures that developers are well-equipped to meet the demands of modern storytelling and design, solidifying its role as a cornerstone in the future of digital innovation.
