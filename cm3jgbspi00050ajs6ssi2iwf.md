## **Introduction**

In game development, a well-functioning camera system is crucial for providing players with an immersive experience. A camera that keeps all actors in view ensures that the gameplay remains smooth and visually coherent. In this tutorial, we will guide you through the process of creating a camera system in Unreal Engine that auto-adjusts its arm length to keep actors in view. We will cover practical steps using Blueprints, delve into the theory behind the code, and explore the math involved in auto-adjusting the camera’s arm length.

## **Setting Up the Camera Actor**

### **Create the actor and add the components.**

1\. **Create a new Blueprint Class** by right-clicking in the Content Browser and selecting **Blueprint Class**.

2\. Choose **Actor** as the parent class, I named it **BP\_ExternalCam**.

3\. Open **BP\_ExternalCam** and add a **Spring Arm** and a **Camera** component.

4\. Adjust the Spring Arm’s length and attach the Camera to the end of the Spring Arm.

## **Creating the Camera System**

### **Step-by-Step Guide**

1\. **Open the Event Graph** of **BP\_ExternalCam**.

2\. **Add a new variable** to store the actors you want to keep in view. Name it **ActorsToTrack** and set its type to **Array of Actors**.

### **Using Blueprints to Implement the Camera Logic**

1\. In the **Tick** event, **get the bounds** of all actors in **ActorsToTrack**.

2\. **Move the camera** to the center of the actors using **SetActorLocation**.

3\. Calculate the required arm length using the formula derived from the math section (armLength = bounds.length/tan(cameraFov)).

4\. **Set the Spring Arm’s length** to the calculated value using **SetTargetArmLength**.

## **Theory Behind the Code**

### **Explanation of the Logic**

The camera system continuously updates its position and arm length based on the actors’ positions. By calculating the center of all actors and the furthest distance between them, the camera can adjust its arm length to ensure all actors remain in view.

## **Math Involved**

### **Detailed Breakdown**

To calculate the required arm length, we use basic trigonometry. The camera’s field of view (FOV) can be split to form a right triangle with the actors' distance. By using the tangent function, we can determine the necessary arm length.

### **Calculations**

**Determine the angles** of the triangle:

1\. A = 45° **(FOV/2)**

2\. C = 90°

3\. B = 45° **(180 - (A + C))**

**Use the tangent function**:

1\. tan(A) = a/b

2\. Rearrange to find b: b = a / tan(A)

3\. **Apply the formula** in Blueprints to calculate the arm length.

## **Testing and Debugging**

### **How to Test the Camera System**

1\. **Place multiple actors** in the scene and add them to the **ActorsToTrack** array.

2\. **Run the game** and observe the camera’s behavior.

3\. **Adjust parameters** as needed to ensure smooth operation.

### **Common Issues and Resolutions**

1\. **Camera not keeping all actors in view**: Ensure all actors are correctly added to the **ActorsToTrack** array. You can also use **GetAllActorsOfClass** on the Begin Play event to get all the actors you want to track; remember to add these actors to **ActorsToTrack**.

2\. **Camera jittering**: Use interpolation functions like **FInterpTo** for smooth transitions.

## **Conclusion**

In this tutorial, we covered creating a camera system in Unreal Engine that keeps actors in view by auto-adjusting its arm's length. We explored the practical steps using Blueprints, the theory behind the code, and the math involved. Feel free to experiment and customize the camera system to suit your project’s needs.
