## **Why Choose Epic Online Services?**

**Why Choose Epic Online Services?** Epic Online Services (EOS) stands out as a premier choice for game developers looking to enhance their online gaming experience. Here’s why:

1. **Comprehensive and Free:** EOS offers a wide range of services, including voice chat, achievements, matchmaking, and live operations, all for free. This comprehensive suite of tools allows developers to focus on creating engaging gameplay without worrying about the backend infrastructure.
    
2. **Cross-Platform Play:** One of the most significant advantages of EOS is its cross-platform capabilities.

3. **Ease of Integration:** EOS is designed to be easily integrated with popular game engines like Unreal Engine and Unity. This ease of integration means you can quickly implement these services into your game, reducing development time and effort.
    

### **Why Use a Pre-Made Online Subsystem?**

Creating your own online subsystem can be a daunting and resource-intensive task. Here’s why using a pre-made solution like EOS is beneficial:

**Time and Resource Savings** Developing an online subsystem from scratch requires significant time, expertise, and resources. By using EOS, you can leverage a proven and reliable system, allowing you to focus on game development rather than backend infrastructure.

**Scalability and Reliability** EOS is built to handle the demands of modern online gaming, ensuring scalability and reliability. This means you can confidently grow your player base without worrying about server performance or downtime.

**Cost Efficiency** Using a pre-made solution like EOS, Steamworks, or Playfab can be more cost-effective compared to creating your own Online Subsystem, renting servers, and creating your own frameworks. EOS provides a comprehensive set of services for free, helping you save on development and operational costs.

**Comparison with Other Alternatives** While there are several alternatives available, EOS offers a unique combination of features, ease of use, and cost efficiency. Here’s a brief comparison:

* **Steamworks**: While Steamworks offers robust features, it is primarily tied to the Steam platform and limited to PC platforms, restricting cross-platform play.
    
* **AWS Gamelift**: AWS Gamelift provides excellent server hosting but can be costly and requires significant setup and management. However, it can be integrated with EOS to provide dedicated servers for your game.
    
* **Xsolla**: Xsolla offers various services, including payment processing and marketing, but may not provide the same level of integration and ease of use as EOS.
    
* **Playfab**: Playfab is a comprehensive backend platform and a good competitor, but it comes with a cost. It can also be integrated with EOS, allowing you to have dedicated servers for your game.
    

By choosing EOS, you benefit from a powerful, cost-effective, and easy-to-integrate solution that enhances your game’s online capabilities and provides a seamless experience for your players.

## **My Experience with EOS**

### **Integrating EOS into Party Madness**

[![Party Madness DLTAKY minigame](https://images.prismic.io/loartdev-v2/ZrGSdEaF0TcGIs2y_PM_M_Anvil_Gameplay.gif?auto=format%2Ccompress&fit=max&w=1920 align="center")](https://loart.dev/games/party-madness)

Creating my game, [***Party Madness***](https://loart.dev/games/party-madness), was an exciting journey, and [integrating Epic Online Services (EOS)](https://blog.loart.dev/boost-your-unreal-engine-game-best-eos-plugin-options) played a crucial role in its development. In this game, I utilized many of the game services and account services provided by EOS. The game used a peer-to-peer (P2P) connection to create matches that players could join from anywhere in the world. Additionally, I implemented the account system, allowing players to use their existing accounts from Epic Games, Google, Steam, Xbox, or any other supported platform. Although I only released the game for Windows, the system was compatible with all platforms, thanks to EOS's cross-platform capabilities.

The integration process was straightforward, thanks to the integrated plugin in Unreal Engine 5. This made it easy to incorporate EOS features into my game without extensive coding or configuration. The analytics provided by EPS were particularly helpful, as they allowed me to identify and fix bugs, ultimately improving the game's performance and player experience.

### **Challenges and Solutions**

One of the main problems I faced while creating an online multiplayer game was managing users. EOS made this easy by allowing me to see who was in the session with easy-to-use C++ functions and the integration of many account services on their subsystem. Another challenge was finding a way to start the project, but thanks to the Unreal Engine community and EOS support, this was superfast, and all the issues I encountered were solved quickly by the community of developers.

### **Standout Features of EOS**

Several features of EOS stood out to me and significantly improved my game's performance and player experience:

* **Lobbies**: This feature allowed me to control the current players in the lobby, manage their information, and change settings for the session while keeping a simple game structure.
    
* **Cross-Platform Play**: The ability to connect players across different platforms was a game-changer. It allowed me to reach a broader audience and create a more inclusive gaming community.
    
* **Account Services**: The shared account services made it easy for players to log in using their existing accounts, enhancing the overall user experience.
    
* **Analytics and Insights**: The detailed analytics provided by EOS helped me identify and fix bugs, optimize game performance, and make data-driven decisions to improve the game.
    
* **Ease of Integration**: The seamless integration with Unreal Engine 5 made it easy to implement EOS features without extensive coding or configuration.
    

Overall, EOS provided a comprehensive and reliable solution that enhanced my game development process and delivered a superior gaming experience for players.
